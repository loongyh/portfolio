## Problem

When a client wishes to set-up a webstore, there are many options nowadays. Small business owners without a web development team usually contract a freelancer or web development firm to do it for them. [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) and [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) are two of the most popular platforms deployed. Such projects usually are one-off thing and once the developer receives and payment is completed, unless there is a maintenance contract,

These usually have a backend server that collects data from a database and builds the page on the fly each time a user requests it. We call such sites “dynamically-generated” sites. [](https://www.shopify.com/)Not only it takes time for the server to build each page, the presence of an always-running backend and database presents an ever-increasing risk of a breach of customer data.
