## Problem

When a client wishes to set-up a webstore, there are many options nowadays. Small business owners without a web development team usually contract a freelancer or web development firm to do it for them. [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) and [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) are two of the most popular platforms deployed. Such projects are usually a one-off thing and once the developer receives payment, unless there is a maintenance contract, the system is handed over to the customer to manage.

Self-hosted sites like WooCommerce, which is based on WordPress, usually have an always-running backend that serves the pages by collecting data from a database and builds the page on demand each time a user requests it. We call such sites “dynamically-generated” sites. On budget hosting plans, this usually results in a very slow browsing experience for customers.

The presence of an exposed backend and database also presents an ever-increasing risk of breach of customer data, since most clients will not have the technical know-how to keep the WordPress packages up-to-date against the latest security vulnerabilities.

## Solution

A client approached me to build a webstore for small-volume sales. Budget and ease-of-use was their primary concern. I proposed  the latest“statically-generated” sites have each page pre-built and ready to be served on request. The end result is a much snappier user experience.
