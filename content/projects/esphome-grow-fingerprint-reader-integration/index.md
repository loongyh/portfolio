## Intro

Physical locks and keys were invented as early as [6th century BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_and_key), and we're in the 21st century now. Time to replace ALL of them with something more modern!

## Problem

...hold that thought. Most commercial digital locks (for now) aren't cheap. Take a look at the models offered at [MyDigitalLock](https://www.mydigitallock.com.sg/digital-lock/), and you'll realise the cost of replacing just 4 bedroom door locks in a standard HDB flat with digital locks easily sets you back at least several hundred S$.

## Solution

The [R503](http://en.hzgrow.com/product/132.html) capacitive fingerprint reader is an affordable (US$13) fingerprint sensor module made by [Hangzhou Grow Technology Co., Ltd](http://en.hzgrow.com/nav/9.html).
