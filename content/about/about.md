Since university graduation, I continued my final year project to automate everything in the home.

My dream is to make fully integrated and localised home automation accessible for everyone. That meant bringing the entire house to life by automating everything such as lights, fans, windows, curtains, doors, air conditioning etc. This involved sourcing low cost mechatronics and hardware from China and networking them such that they can be operated remotely via an automation system - adopting and writing integrations for the opensource [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) + [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/).

After 3 years working on the project and freelancing for, I made the decision to shelve the idea and embark on a software engineering career with [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) in August 2021. I have since learnt much about how software is done in the enterprise. In the process, I have contributed to efforts in maintenance of the core payment platform codebase.
In January 2022, I represented PayPal as a co-hacker in the [Hack for Public Good 2022](https://www.open.gov.sg/hackathon/2022) hackathon organised by Open Government Products, where I collaborated with a team on a project and contributed frontend React.js code.

During weekends and off-work hours, I usually chill at home watching US shows or playing video games. Recognising my lack of social life and work-life balance throughout my start-up years, these days I do make time to occasionally hang out with friends, meet new people, or embark on adhoc projects/hobbies as I'm still passionate about making stuff. In the process I keep up with the latest tech developments and am always on the look out for new opportunities.
