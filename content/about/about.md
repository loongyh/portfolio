Since university graduation, I continued my final year project to automate everything in the home.

My dream is to make home automation accessible for everyone.\
In the process, I have managed to source affordable, high quality and practical commercial hardware from China.\
I have integrated these hardware into the [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) and by extension [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) platforms.\
My efforts are now part of these opensource projects.

I made the decision to embark on a software engineering career with [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) in August 2021 and gained the opportunity to learn much about how software is made in the enterprise.
In the process, I have contributed to efforts in maintenance of the core payment platform codebase.
In January 2022, I represented PayPal as a co-hacker in the [Hack for Public Good 2022](https://www.open.gov.sg/hackathon/2022) hackathon organised by Open Government Products, where I collaborated with a team on a project and contributed frontend code.
